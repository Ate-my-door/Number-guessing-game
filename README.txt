NUMBER GUESSING GAME
--------------------

Very simple game from the "Hello World!" 
book by Warren and Carter Sande. Now it is 
rewritten for the C++ programming languge 
just for fun. 

It is not very playable, but its source code 
may be interesting for people making their 
first steps at programming. 

WARNING!
This game contains uncensored pirated 
offensive language :-)
